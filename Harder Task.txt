write a class that calculates Collatz conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
it should save the resulting sequence of numbers into ResultSequence variable and also print it as it is being calculated;


class CollatzCalculator{

	public List<int> ResultSequence;


	public void Calculate(int starting_value) 
	{

	}


}
